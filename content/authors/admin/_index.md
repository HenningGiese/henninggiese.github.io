bio: >
  Henning Giese is a postdoctoral researcher at Paderborn University (Germany). His research focuses on multidimensional aspects of taxation with an emphasis on tax departments, tax complexity, and the effects of fiscal policy. One strand of his work examines factors that influence the design and performance of tax departments. A second strand investigates determinants and consequences of tax complexity. Several of his studies explore how tax policy shapes firm-level outcomes, such as tax compliance and risk-taking, and initiatives that advance the green transition.
