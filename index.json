To this end, the asymptotic properties of recursive, or adaptive, procedures for the removal of general additive deterministic components are analyzed in two different, complementary, situations. When the stochastic component of the examined time series is weakly stationary (as would be the equilibrium errors), the effect of recursive adjustment vanishes with increasing sample size. When the suitably normalized stochastic component converges weakly to some limiting continuous-time process with integrable paths (as would be the case with the common stochastic trends), recursive adjustment has a permanent effect even asymptotically: the normalized recursively adjusted process converges weakly to a recursively adjusted version of the limiting process. The null limiting distributions of the cointegration rank tests can be expressed in terms of recursively adjusted Brownian motions. Moreover, the finite-sample properties of the cointegration rank tests with recursive adjustment are examined in cases of empirical relevance: the considered deterministic components are a constant, and a constant and a linear trend, respectively. Compared to the likelihood ratio tests or the tests with generalized least squares adjustment, improvements in terms of empirical rejection frequencies under the null are found in finite samples; improvements are found under the alternative as well, with the likelihood ratio test performing increasingly better as the magnitude of the initial condition increases. Regarding rank selection, a very simple combination of the three testing procedures with different adjustments performs best.","tags":[],"title":"Recursive Adjustment for General Deterministic Components and Improved Tests for the Cointegration Rank","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Johannes Pfeifer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"35ef3a2736ca32cb118e1dca308b2768","permalink":"https://BenjaminBorn.github.io/publication/bornpfeifer_comment_2014/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T22:11:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bornpfeifer_comment_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the risk-shock business cycle model of Fernández-Villaverde et al.

While fiscal policy accounts for about 15% of output variance at business cycle frequencies, this mostly derives from anticipated government spending shocks. Tax shocks, both anticipated and unanticipated, contribute little to the fluctuations of real variables. However, anticipated capital tax shocks do explain a sizable part of inflation fluctuations, accounting for up to 12% of its variance. In line with earlier studies, news shocks in total account for about 50% of output variance. Further decomposing this news effect, we find permanent total factor productivity news shocks to be most important. When looking at the federal level instead of total government, the importance of anticipated tax and spending shocks significantly increases, suggesting that fiscal policy at the subnational level typically counteracts the effects of federal fiscal policy shocks.","tags":[],"title":"Fiscal News and Macroeconomic Volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Falko Juessen","Gernot J.

Moreover, central banks must manage expectations by clearly communicating what macroprudential policy can achieve, and what its limitations are, to counteract reputational risks. This paper also provides empirical evidence showing that financial markets react significantly and systematically to central bank communication about financial stability issues.
